Do you feel this project helped you to understand the following ideas:
(please answer yes, no, somewhat, and comment on what if anything could have improved your learning experience).

1. The main steps of a robot localization algorithm

2. Dealing with real-world sensors

3. Dealing with real-world motors and robot motions

4. Using probabilities to keep track of belief about a robot's position

5. Managing uncertainty (e.g. in the quality of sensor readings, or accuracy of robot motions)

6. Do you feel confident you could implement a probabilistic localization algorithm for a more complex robot,
   working in a real world environment? (please explain your answer)

7. Any other comments regarding your experience with this project?
